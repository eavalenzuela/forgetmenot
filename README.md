local looting script in python

Note: This script is incomplete! Currently it only does some light Linux looting, including scraping bashrc alias information and pulling lists of pdf, doc, and txt files in user folders. It also now searches for potential 'flag' files, for CTFs.

Total programming time as of last commit: 3.25 hours
