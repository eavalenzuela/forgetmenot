local looting script in python

Note: This script is incomplete! 

Currently it does the following:
Dumps environment variables for Lin+Win, dumps aliases in users' bashrc files on Lin, compiles lists of user files (e.g. pdfs, docs, txt files) on Lin, scrapes log files for unique IP addresses on Lin, and hunts for possible flag files on Lin+Win.

Total programming time as of last commit: 6.75 hours
